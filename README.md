# About Me

In my free time (when I’m not with my family), I enjoy coding and security research. I started with Python in 2023 using Python Crash Course (3rd Edition, Eric Matthes) and then transitioned almost entirely to Java. Since October 2024, I’ve focused on building a strong foundation in core Java and understanding how things work under the hood. During that time, I also earned an undergraduate certificate in Vulnerability Assessment through UMGC with a focus on building secure applications. 

Now I’m working toward becoming confident with Spring Boot and Spring Security through the Spring Guides and O’Reilly course materials. I balance those studies with hands-on security practice on TryHackMe, which helps me understand both sides of security: how to build systems responsibly and how to analyze them with a curious, informed mindset.

# Currently Studying for Junior Penetration Tester (PT1)

### What is the PT1 certification?
The Penetration Tester 1 (PT1) certification is a practical, hands-on certification that validates the skills of aspiring and current Junior Pentesters with realistic scenarios, providing a true-to-life experience of operating as an offensive security professional.


The PT1 exam is divided into three sections: Application, Network and Active Directory Pentest. These sections cover the fundamental skill set that an entry-level professional needs to excel at their job. Candidates will be evaluated on their ability to identify, exploit and report on vulnerabilities, just like in a real pentest.


PT1 also offers flexibility, with time management becoming a key skill. Candidates have 48 hours to complete the different sections at their own pace.

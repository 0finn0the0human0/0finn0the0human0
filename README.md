## About Me

I started coding two years ago after being inspired by a coworker who had written a tool in VBA to help him with his work. I learned Python with Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition by Eric Matthes and then transitioned almost entirely into Java. For the last fourteen months, I’ve focused on building a strong foundation in core Java and understanding how things work under the hood.

During that time, I also earned an undergraduate certificate in vulnerability assessment with a focus on building secure applications. Now I’m working toward becoming confident with Spring Boot and Spring Security through Spring | Guides and online course materials at O'Reilly. I enjoy balancing my Spring studies with hands‑on security practice on TryHackMe, and I believe the combination is helping me grow into someone who understands both sides of security - how to build systems responsibly and how to analyze them with a curious, informed mindset.
